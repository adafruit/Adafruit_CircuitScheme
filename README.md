# Adafruit_CircuitScheme

CircuitScheme is an implementation of a Scheme subset running on CircuitPython. It's based on code "Lispy" written years ago by Peter Norvig and described in:

[(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](http://norvig.com/lispy.html)

[(An ((Even Better) Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](http://norvig.com/lispy2.html)

Beyond porting to CircuitPython, it adds the ability to access the hardware libraries from CircuitPython, making it a viable alternative to and extension of working in CircuitPython.

Love to code in Lisp, but love the Circuit Python infrastructure?  This might be a project for you.
